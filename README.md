# shopping-website-app
I have hands-on experience in developing a feature-rich shopping app using Vue.js, Vuex, Firebase, Firestore, and Bootstrap. The app enables users to effortlessly search for products, navigate through the shopping list, and perform essential actions such as login, logout, add to favorites, add to cart, make secure payments, place orders, and even initiate returns.
