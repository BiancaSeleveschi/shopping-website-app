# shopping-website-app
I have hands-on experience in developing a feature-rich shopping app using Vue.js, Vuex, Firebase, Firestore, and Bootstrap. 

The app enables users to effortlessly search for products, navigate through the shopping list, and perform essential actions such as login, logout, add to favorites, add to cart, make secure payments, place orders, and even initiate returns.

Firestore as the database for storing all the products in the shopping app. Firestore provides a scalable and flexible solution for managing product data, allowing for efficient retrieval and seamless integration with the app's features. With Firestore, the app can easily fetch and display product information, ensuring a smooth and reliable shopping experience for users.

I have expertise in building a shopping app that incorporates a robust authentication system using Firebase Auth. This allows users to create accounts, securely log in, and access personalized features tailored to their preferences. With Firebase Auth, users can track their orders, manage their shopping history, and enjoy a seamless and secure shopping experience.

The favorites feature allows users to save and bookmark their preferred products. By adding items to their favorites, users can easily revisit and keep track of the products they are interested in, streamlining their decision-making process.

The app also prioritizes efficient browsing and searching. Users can explore a wide range of products, filter them based on different criteria, and access detailed information about each item. This empowers users to find the desired products quickly and make well-informed purchasing decisions.
